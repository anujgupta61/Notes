Client-server architecture, architecture of a computer network in which many clients (remote processors) request and receive service from a centralized server
(host computer).
Client computers provide an interface to allow a computer user to request services of the server and to display the results the server returns.
Servers wait for requests to arrive from clients and then respond to them.
Clients are often situated at workstations or on personal computers, while servers are located elsewhere on the network, usually on more powerful machines.
This computing model is especially effective when clients and the server each have distinct tasks that they routinely perform.
For example, In hospital data processing, a client computer can be running an application program for entering patient information while the server computer is running
another program that manages the database in which the information is permanently stored.
Many clients can access the serverâ€™s information simultaneously, and, at the same time, a client computer can perform other tasks, such as sending e-mail.
